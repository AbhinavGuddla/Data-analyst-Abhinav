Key Features of the Policy

1.	Academic Performance Assessment 

The policy starts with outlining the minimum academic standards of students offering undergraduate and post-graduate programs, respectively. According to it, the status of a student will be determined after he or she has tried nine credits of courses. Finally, students will get an official classification of Academic Standing for CGPA and Term GPA for the academic year finished. However, it must be mentioned that the courses done in the capacities of Undergraduate Academic Preparation (UAP) program or MBA Foundation courses are not considered as they do not belong to the degree program.

2.	Undergraduate Academic Standing 

It has enumerated several steps that the institution observes in handling undergraduate students based on the severity of the problem, depending on the student's performance. The key stages include: 

a. Academic Alert 

An Academic Alert is given to an undergraduate student whenever he/ she has a CGPA of less than 2.00 after taking 9 credits. Finally, the student is to be informed by the Registrar's Office through an Academic Alert letter. In the case where the student's CGPA is still below 2.00 but the Term GPA is 2.00 the student will continue to be on alert status, which allows him/her to increase his/her performance as well as access necessary assistance from the university. 

b. Academic Probation 

A CGPA and Term GPA below 2.00 indicates that a student performs poorly in his or her classes, which can lead to unpleasant consequences. Subsequent term after being on an Academic Alert, the student will be on an Academic Probation. This status means that the learner is on probation, and if it does not shape up, he or she may be expelled or suspended. During probation, students may be allowed to repeat courses, among which the total number of repeats should not be more than 4 retakes, and these students are not allowed to take a full course load. This allows the student to concentrate on boosting his/her grade without much pressure from the number of courses offered. 

If a student has his/her Term GPA more than 2.00 during their probationary period but CGPA is low when it should be at least 2.00, students will be on Academic Probation until their CGPA meets the minimum required standard. 

c. Academic Suspension 

If a student's CGPA and Term GPA are below 2.00, then he/she is given a warning that they may be expelled from the university. Academic Probation The student shall be placed on Academic Probation if he/she earns. Grade Point Average while on Academic Probation, he/she shall be placed on Academic Suspension. Suspension is a more severe punishment, preventing the student from attending classes and registering for courses in the following Term and the next semester. After the suspension period, the student will return to probationary status. Should the student's CGPA go up and reach and exceed during their probationary period after Suspension, Their academic standing shall be considered as "Good Academic Standing." 

Students may be termed academically suspended if they get three or more "F" grades in one Term. If their Term, cumulative GPA and GPA, respectively, are less than 2.00 after already being on Academic Probation," All of these penalties show that the student is punished when he/she reaches the Academic Probation stage. In the case of an academic suspension, the result will appear on the student's academic transcript. 

d. Required To Withdraw (RTW) 

The worst outcome of poor academic performance is the student having to Withdraw from the University (RTW). It should also be noted that students who do not make a CGPA and GPA of 2. 00 after their Academic Suspension will be placed in RTW status. This results in their not being allowed to register for courses for at least one year. After this time, they may apply to be readmitted to the university, but if they return, they will be on Academic Probation. If a student is Required to Withdraw a second time, HE/SHE cannot be readmitted to the institution again. 

RTW status is documented in the student's official transcript, making the outcome an academic and even more serious one.

3.	Graduate Academic Standing 

The procedures for graduate students are similar to those for undergraduates but with higher GPA requirements: The procedures for graduate students are similar to those for undergraduates but with higher GPA requirements: 

a. Academic Alert 

In order to achieve and maintain the student's status, graduate students are expected to have a CGPA of 3.00. An Academic Alert is given when a graduate student's CGPA is below 3. 00 after having tried nine credits. Hence, if the student's Term GPA is above 3. 00 but the CGPA of such student is still below, he/she will continue being on Academic Alert. 

b. Academic Probation 

If a graduate student's CGPA and Term GPA are below 3.00 in the next Term after receiving an Academic Alert, the Registrar's Office will place the student on Academic Probation. Probation of graduate students may entail probation requirements that include repeating up to a maximum of 3, course repetition, and enrolment to a maximum of 3 courses. 

Even as with undergraduates, if the student's CGPA remains below 3.00 but Term GPA is greater than 3.00, they will remain probationers and be required to achieve a minimum CGPA as stated above. 

c. Academic Suspension 

Graduate students can be put under Academic Suspension if their CGPA and Term GPA are below 3. 00 in the first year they enrol on any campus while on Academic Probation. Suspended students cannot enrol for courses for at least two consecutive semesters and resume probation if they return. Academic Suspension is a notation made on the graduate student's permanent record. 

d. Required to Withdraw (RTW) 

According to the above description of graduation requirements, if a graduate student cannot make a CGPA and GPA of 3.00 after Academic Suspension, they will retire or be asked to Withdraw from the university. They cannot even register for other courses for at least one year, and upon attempting to rejoin the course, he or she will be put on probation. In particular, the second RTW will prevent the student from being readmitted to the school in the future.

Appeals and Responsibilities 

Schoolchildren are capable of disputing results once overall results are compiled and submitted. However, they cannot appeal their Academic Standing unless they intend to appeal grades on a particular courseâ€¦ Further, the students can apply for a leave of absence in extraordinary conditions like health, maternity or military obligations.
